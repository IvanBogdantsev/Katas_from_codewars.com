 The most basic encryption method is to map a char to another char by a certain math rule. Because every char has an ASCII value, we can manipulate this value with a simple math expression. For example 'a' + 1 would give us 'b', because 'a' value is 97 and 'b' value is 98.
 
 You will need to write a method which does exactly that -
 
 get a string as text and an int as the rule of manipulation, and should return encrypted text. for example:
 
 encrypt("a",1) = "b"
 
 Full ascii table is used on our question (256 chars) - so 0-255 are the valid values.
 
 If the value exceeds 255, it should 'wrap'. ie. if the value is 345 it should wrap to 89.
 
 Good luck.

 In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.
 
 Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:
 
 n=7, k=3 => means 7 people in a circle
 one every 3 is eliminated until one remains
 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
 [1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out
 [1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out
 [1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out
 [1,4,5] => 7 is counted out
 [1,4] => 5 is counted out
 [4] => 1 counted out, 4 is the last element - the survivor!
 
 The above link about the "base" kata description will give you a more thorough insight about the origin of this kind of permutation, but basically that's all that there is to know to solve this kata.
 
 Notes and tips: using the solution to the other kata to check your function may be helpful, but as much larger numbers will be used, using an array/list to compute the number of the survivor may be too slow; you may assume that both n and k will always be >=1.

 The Language

 MiniStringFuck is a derivative of the famous Brainfuck which contains a memory cell as its only form of data storage as opposed to a memory tape of 30,000 cells in Brainfuck. The memory cell in MiniStringFuck initially starts at 0. MiniStringFuck contains only 2 commands as opposed to 8:

 + - Increment the memory cell. If it reaches 256, wrap to 0.
 . - Output the value of the memory cell as a character with code point equal to the value
 For example, here is a MiniStringFuck program that outputs the string "Hello, World!":

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.+++++++..+++.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.++++++++++++++++++++++++.+++.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.
 And here is another program that prints the uppercase English alphabet:

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.+.
 Any characters in a MiniStringFuck program other than + or . are simply non-command characters (no-ops, i.e. do nothing) and therefore can serve as comments in the program.

 The Task

 Time to write your first Esolang interpreter :D

 Your task is to implement a MiniStringFuck interpreter myFirstInterpreter()/my_first_interpreter()/Interpreter()/interpret() MyFirstInterpreter() (depending on your language) which accepts exactly 1 required argument code/$code/strng which is the MiniStringFuck program to be executed. The output of the program should then be returned by your interpreter as a string.

 Since this is the first time you are about to write an interpreter for an Esolang, here are a few quick tips:

 If you are afraid that your interpreter will be confused by non-command characters appearing in the MiniStringFuck program, you can try to remove all non-command characters from the code input before letting your interpreter interpret it
 The memory cell in MiniStringFuck only ever contains a single integer value - think of how it can be modelled in your interpreter
 If you are stuck as to how to interpret the string as a program, try thinking of strings as an array of characters. Try looping through the "program" like you would an array
 Writing an interpreter for an Esolang can sometimes be quite confusing! It never hurts to add a few comments in your interpreter as you implement it to remind yourself of what is happening within the interpreter at every stage
 NOTE: If you would not like to name your interpreter as myFirstInterpreter()/my_first_interpreter(), you can optionally rename it to either miniStringFuck()/mini_string_fuck() or interpreter() instead - the test cases will handle the rest for you. Not available in Java, Go, Swift, TypeScript, Haskell, Elixir, C++, C#, Rust, R, Erlang, F#, Factor, COBOL and NASM; irrelevant to Brainfuck solvers ;)

 Good luck :D

 Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears).

 Examples

 Valid arrays

 a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
 b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
 comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121, 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on. It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:

 a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
 b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]
 Invalid arrays

 If, for example, we change the first number to something else, comp is not returning true anymore:

 a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
 b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
 comp(a,b) returns false because in b 132 is not the square of any number of a.

 a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
 b = [121, 14641, 20736, 36100, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
 comp(a,b) returns false because in b 36100 is not the square of any number of a.

 Remarks

 a or b might be [] or {} (all languages except R, Shell).
 a or b might be nil or null or None or nothing (except in C++, COBOL, Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, F#, Haskell, Nim, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PowerShell, Prolog, PureScript, R, Racket, Rust, Shell, Swift).
